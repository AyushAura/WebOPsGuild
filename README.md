HTML Structure

Key Parts:<textarea id="noteInput">: This is where the user writes a new note.
Save and Clear Buttons:
<button id="saveBtn">Save Note</button>: Saves the note the user has entered.
<button id="clearBtn">Clear Notes</button>: Clears all saved notes.
<div id="notesContainer">: This is where saved notes will be displayed dynamically.

Modal for Editing:
<div id="editModal" class="modal">: A hidden modal that allows users to edit a note.
Inside the modal, we have another <textarea> for editing the note and buttons to update or cancel the edit.

2. CSS Styling
Key Parts:
body and .container: This styles the main body and container, centering everything on the screen and adding margins, padding, and a simple box-shadow for a clean look.
textarea and button: Styles the note input area and buttons with consistent padding, border-radius, and colors. Hover effects are added for interactive feedback when users hover over buttons.
.note: This class styles the individual notes that are displayed in the container, giving them a border and background color.
.modal and .modal-content: These classes handle the modal for editing notes. Initially, the modal is hidden using display: none. When activated, it appears as an overlay on the screen.

3. JavaScript Functionality

4. Event Listeners and Functions
Window onload Function
window.onload: When the page loads, this function calls loadNotes(), which will fetch and display any previously saved notes from localStorage.
Save Note
saveBtn.addEventListener('click', ...): When the "Save Note" button is clicked, this event listener gets the text from the noteInput textarea, checks if it's not empty, and then saves it using the saveNote() function.
saveNote(): This function:
Retrieves all notes from localStorage (if there are any).
Adds the new note to the array.
Saves the updated array back to localStorage.
Load Notes
loadNotes(): This function:
Clears the current content in notesContainer.
Retrieves saved notes from localStorage.
For each note, it creates a new div to display it and appends it to notesContainer. Each note also gets two buttons:
Edit Button: Opens the modal to allow editing.
Delete Button: Deletes the note.
Delete Notes
deleteNote(index): This function removes the note at the specified index from the list of notes in localStorage, then reloads the notes to update the display.
Clear All Notes
clearBtn.addEventListener('click', ...): When the "Clear Notes" button is clicked, this function removes all notes from localStorage and calls loadNotes() to update the display.

5. Modal for Editing Notes
Open Edit Modal
editBtn.addEventListener('click', ...): When the edit button is clicked on a note, it opens the modal, pre-fills the note content into the editNoteInput field, and saves the index of the note being edited to editIndex.
Close Edit Modal
cancelBtn.addEventListener('click', ...): This closes the modal without saving changes.
Update Note
updateBtn.addEventListener('click', ...): When the update button inside the modal is clicked:
It fetches the edited note from the editNoteInput.
Replaces the original note in the array of saved notes using editIndex.
Saves the updated array back to localStorage.
Closes the modal and reloads the notes.

6. localStorage Explanation
localStorage is a key-value storage mechanism provided by the browser that allows you to store data persistently across page reloads.
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('notes')): This retrieves the saved notes from localStorage and converts them from a JSON string back into a JavaScript array.
localStorage.setItem('notes', JSON.stringify(notes)): This takes an array of notes, converts it into a JSON string, and saves it in localStorage.
Summary of Features
Create Notes: Users can type a new note in the textarea and save it. The note is stored in localStorage and displayed below.
Edit Notes: Each note has an edit button, which opens a modal for editing the note.
Delete Notes: Each note has a delete button to remove it from the list and localStorage.
Clear All Notes: The "Clear Notes" button removes all notes from localStorage and clears the display.
